The first "website" I built was sometime around 2006/2007. It was for my clan in Ikariam.  
That introduced me to HTML/CSS, but once the job was done, I did not really go further.

Following that, as a freshman Computer Engineering student, I built my personal website with large ambitions, hoping it
would help me land internships. While I am not sure if it had any impact in me eventually getting some internships, it
was an iterative process keeping it up to date as life progressed.

This was heavily inspired by Debarghya Das' website, which I found to be very well designed and informative.  
The old site is a static Bootstrap 3 build.

## Old Stack

- HTML + Bootstrap 3 for layout and components  
- jQuery + Bootstrap JS for interactivity  
- Font Awesome icons + Google Fonts (Montserrat)  
- Custom CSS in a single stylesheet  
- Fully static — no build tooling, frameworks, or bundlers

Fair to say web design has changed a lot since then, certainly in ways that I think are for the better.  
Now when you browse personal websites it is a lot more retro and minimalist, and I love that.

I wanted to learn some new tools and give my personal site a proper upgrade, so I decided to rebuild it from the ground
up. Since I use the Gemini CLI a lot at work, it was also a great excuse to try Codex on something fun and personal.

## New Stack (2025)

- Astro 5.15 as the static site framework  
- Tailwind CSS for styling (plus a small global stylesheet)  
- MDX + Astro content collections for posts and frontmatter  
- Vite + PostCSS/Autoprefixer for build tooling  
- Minimal client-side JS (theme toggle only), otherwise fully static assets

And most importantly, I actually added my blog!

I am hoping to write about my personal interests and experiences in tech, software development, and more.  
Stay tuned for more posts to come!
