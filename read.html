                <li>A great contrast to 1984. I think this book and 1984 should be read consecutively.</li>

                <li>“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may have luck yet”<br />
                    “I would like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it.” he said<br />
                    What could I buy it with? he added himself. “Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife
                    and two bad hands?””<br />
                    “You might.” he said. “You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you
                    too.”<br />

                <li>I dont think it is possible for George Orwell to write a bad book. A great read that provides more
